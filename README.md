I recently participated in JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Quantitative Research virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to work on a Quantitative Research team at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

I worked on a project that involved forecasting and predictive modeling. I practiced using advanced Python code and built my data analysis and modeling skills in a real-world context.

Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy manipulating large data sets to inform business solutions and Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills on the Quantitative Research team at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
